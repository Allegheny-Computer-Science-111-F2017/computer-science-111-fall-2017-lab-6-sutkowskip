# Reflection by Paul Sutkowski

To complete this lab I had to use commands involing relpacing strings, setting
userinout to uppercase, using random, int, and char, and knowing how to write
the program in a way that will refer to all the changed input and present it
together.

This lab was challenging for me, at first. I was not sure what commands to use
for some time. After I learned what commands were needed, this lab became easy,
though time consuming.
